# FalconDeployment CRD

## Overview

The Falcon Operator introduces a Kubernetes custom resource definition (CRD) named FalconDeployment, which is used to deploy and manage other Falcon-specific custom resources. By using the single `FalconDeployment` manifest, you can control the deployment and configuration of multiple components across your Kubernetes environment.

Use `FalconDeployment` to deploy these Falcon components:

| Component | Resource Name |
| :---- | :---- |
| Falcon Sensor for Linux | `FalconNodeSensor` |
| Falcon Container sensor for Linux | `FalconContainer` |
| Falcon Kubernetes Admission Controller | `FalconAdmission` |
| Falcon Image Assessment at Runtime agent | `FalconImageAnalyzer` |

### Required permissions

The Falcon Operator retrieves the component images from the CrowdStrike registry. If you need to create a new API key, see [API clients and keys](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/api-clients-and-keys). To access the registry, you must have a CrowdStrike API client and key with the necessary scopes for the components you want to deploy.

| Component | Required Permission Scopes |
| :---- | :---- |
| Falcon Image Assessment at Runtime agent | Falcon Container CLI: Write Falcon Container Image: Read/Write Falcon Images Download: Read |
| Falcon Sensor for Linux Falcon Container sensor for Linux Falcon Kubernetes Admission Controller | Falcon Images Download: Read Sensor Download: Read |

**Note:** To use the [Advanced autoupdate setting](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/documentation/page/fd8c8097/falcon-operator---general-deployment#i24900dc), your API key must include this permission scope: Sensor Update Policies: Read

## How the FalconDeployment CRD works

The FalconDeployment acts as a parent resource that manages the deployment and configuration of Falcon component Custom Resources (CRs). It uses a single manifest to simplify and streamline the deployment process across your Kubernetes environment.

This streamlined process allows for easier management, updates, and scaling of your Falcon components within your Kubernetes clusters.

### Configure Falcon components in the single manifest

The FalconDeployment Spec contains fields that are shared by all child components, such as `falcon_api` for configuring Falcon API credentials, as well as fields that enable and optionally configure individual child component settings. For example, when `deployNodeSensor` is `true`, the Falcon Operator deploys the FalconNodeSensor resource using its default settings merged with the settings under falconNodeSensor. The value of falconNodeSensor matches the FalconNodeSensor Spec.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently, configuring `falconSecret` is available for the individual sensor specs, but not at the FalconDeployment top level spec.
> When configuring `falconSecret` with Falcon API credentials for each individual sensor, `falcon_api` for FalconDeployment can be undefined.
> If you decide to configure `falconSecret` at the sensor level spec AND `falcon_api` at the FalconDeployment top level spec,
> you must define `falcon_api.client_id` and `falcon_api.client_secret` in the FalconDeployment spec if `falcon_api.cloud_region: autodiscover`.
> Falcon secret support will be added to FalconDeployment in a future release, coming soon.

### 

### Example Configurations

Here are some examples of how to use the single manifest to deploy Falcon components:

#### Deploy multiple Falcon components with default configurations

This example shows the default configuration for `FalconDeployment`. The default configuration deploys the `FalconAdmissionController`, `FalconImageAnalyzer`, and the `FalconNodeSensor` using their default component configurations, while not deploying the FalconContainer.

```
apiVersion: falcon.crowdstrike.com/v1alpha1
kind: FalconDeployment
metadata:
  name: falcon-deployment
spec:
  falcon_api:
    client_id: PLEASE_FILL_IN
    client_secret: PLEASE_FILL_IN
    cloud_region: PLEASE_FILL_IN
```

**Important**: In most scenarios, you deploy either the FalconNodeSensor for the FalconContainer. The default configuration supports this. However, in some mixed node clusters, for example, when your cluster has both EC2 and Fargate nodes, you can set `deployContainerSensor` to `true`. In this situation, you should deploy the `FalconContainer` to a custom namespace to avoid potential issues with 2 sensor workloads running in the same namespace.

#### Deploy multiple Falcon components with specific image tags

This example demonstrates deploying the `FalconNodeSensor` and `FalconImageAnalyzer` with custom configurations, while not deploying the `FalconAdmissionController` and `FalconContainerSensor`. It highlights how to specify custom images, pull policies, and other configuration options for the enabled components.

```
apiVersion: falcon.crowdstrike.com/v1alpha1
kind: FalconDeployment
metadata:
  name: falcon-deployment
spec:
  falcon_api:
    client_id: PLEASE_FILL_IN
    client_secret: PLEASE_FILL_IN
    cloud_region: PLEASE_FILL_IN
  deployAdmissionController: false
  deployNodeSensor: true
  nodeNamespace: falcon-node
  falconNodeSensor:
    node:
      image: registry.example.com/node-sensor:v1.2
      imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
    falcon:
      trace: warn
  deployImageAnalyzer: true
  falconImageAnalyzer:
    image: registry.example.com/image-analyzer:v2.0
    imageAnalyzerConfig:
      imagePullPolicy: Always
  deployContainerSensor: false

```

#### Deploy multiple Falcon components with custom registry configurations

This example demonstrates deploying the `FalconAdmissionController` and `FalconContainerSensor` with custom registry configurations, while not deploying the `FalconNodeSensor` and `FalconImageAnalyzer`. It highlights how to specify different registry types (ACR and ECR) for the overall deployment and individual components.

```
apiVersion: falcon.crowdstrike.com/v1alpha1
kind: FalconDeployment
metadata:
  name: falcon-deployment
spec:
  falcon_api:
    client_id: PLEASE_FILL_IN
    client_secret: PLEASE_FILL_IN
    cloud_region: PLEASE_FILL_IN
  registry:
    type: acr
    acr_name: my-acr
  deployAdmissionController: true
  deployNodeSensor: false
  deployImageAnalyzer: false
  deployContainerSensor: true
  falconContainerSensor:
    registry:
      type: ecr
      ecr_name: my-ecr
```

## Install the Falcon Operator

You install the Falcon Operator by deploying the operator resource to the cluster. These steps differ if your cluster is using Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).

Determine if your cluster is using OLM by running:

`kubectl get crd catalogsources.operators.coreos.com`

If your cluster has OLM, you'll see:

`NAME CREATED AT`  
clusterserviceversions.operators.coreos.com `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`

If your cluster does not have OLM, you'll see:

`Error from server (NotFound): customresourcedefinitions.apiextensions.k8s.io "catalogsources.operators.coreos.com" not found`

If your cluster is not using OLM, install the Operator with `kubectl`:

`kubectl apply -f https://github.com/crowdstrike/falcon-operator/releases/latest/download/falcon-operator.yaml`

If your cluster is using OLM and your cluster is not Red Hat OpenShift, you can install the Operator with either: CrowdStrike Falcon Platform \- Operator on OperatorHub.io or Falcon Operator on ArtifactHUB

When the Falcon Operator is installed, [retrieve your sensor images](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/documentation/page/eb6c645d/retrieve-the-falcon-sensor-image-for-your-deployment) and then [deploy the Falcon components](#deploy-falcon-components).

**Note**: ArtifactHUB provides an alternative method for OLM-style installations.

## Deploy Falcon components {#deploy-falcon-components}

This command creates and applies the FalconDeployment manifest file for the Falcon Operator, allowing you to edit it before applying, which enables you to deploy and manage CrowdStrike Falcon resources in your Kubernetes cluster.

To install Falcon Operator:

1. Create and open the FalconDeployment manifest file for editing. Make sure to replace `[version_number]` with the correct version tag.  
   `kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crowdstrike/falcon-operator/refs/tags/[version_number]/config/samples/falcon_v1alpha1_falcondeployment.yaml --edit=true`  
2. Set the individual resources in the Spec section of the manifest to `true` or `false`. To see basic deployment examples, see [Falcon Operator Spec examples](?tab=t.0#heading=h.d6esf7ainssd).  
3. Optional. Provide your custom configuration within the manifest file for each resource.   
4. Save the new manifest configuration and exit the editor.  
5. The Falcon Operator will automatically detect the changes and initiate the reconciliation process.  
6. The Operator will work to bring the actual state of the cluster in line with the desired state specified in your configuration.

**Note:** When deploying the Kubernetes Admission Controller, the Falcon Operator can trigger multiple restarts for the Falcon Admission Controller Pods when deploying alongside other resources. Falcon KAC is designed to ignore namespaces managed by CrowdStrike, so, as new resources are added, such as falconContainer or falconNodeSensor, the KAC pod will redeploy to ignore the new namespaces.

### Cloud platform-specific deployments

Some cloud platforms have additional configuration requirements. For details, see the appropriate deployment guide:

* AKS  
* EKS  
* Fargate  
* Cloudformation  
* GKE  
* OpenShift

## Modify Falcon components

To add or remove individual resources without a complete uninstallation:

1. Open the current manifest configuration:   
   `kubectl edit falcondeployments`  
2. In the opened editor, modify the Spec field for the desired resources to `true` or `false`.  
3. Set any other individual resources in the Spec as needed.  
4. Provide any custom configuration required.  
5. Save the new manifest configuration and exit the editor.

The Falcon Operator will automatically detect these changes and reconcile them, bringing the actual state of the cluster in line with the newly specified desired state.

## Upgrade Falcon components

Each component deployed with the Falcon Operator can be individually upgraded. Follow these steps to upgrade a component:

1. Open the current manifest configuration for editing:   
   `kubectl edit falcondeployments`  
2. In the opened editor, locate the specific component you want to upgrade.  
3. Update the component version using one of these methods:  
- If using Falcon API credentials: Add or update the `version` field for the component.  
- If using a custom image: Add or update the `image` field for the component.  
4. Save the new manifest configuration and exit the editor.

The Falcon Operator will automatically detect these changes and initiate the upgrade process, reconciling the actual state of the cluster with the newly specified desired state.

**Note**: This process works for all components that can be deployed with the Falcon Operator. The operator handles the implementation details of the upgrade based on your changes.

## Uninstall all Falcon components

To uninstall the Falcon Operator, remove the falcon-operator resource. The operator uninstalls the falcon-operator resource and any CRs deployed from the cluster.

`kubectl delete falcondeployment --all`

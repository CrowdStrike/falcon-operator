# Falcon Container Sensor

## About Falcon Container Sensor
The Falcon Container sensor for Linux extends runtime security to container workloads in Kubernetes clusters that don’t allow you to deploy the kernel-based Falcon sensor for Linux. The Falcon Container sensor runs as an unprivileged container in user space with no code running in the kernel of the worker node OS. This allows it to secure Kubernetes pods in clusters where it isn’t possible to deploy the kernel-based Falcon sensor for Linux on the worker node, as with AWS Fargate where organizations don’t have access to the kernel and where privileged containers are disallowed. The Falcon Container sensor can also secure container workloads on clusters where worker node security is managed separately.

### Core Features
 - **Leverage market-leading protection technologies:** Machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), indicators of attack (IOAs) and custom hash blocking automatically defend against malware and sophisticated threats targeting containers.
 - **Stop malicious behavior:** Behavioral profiling enables you to block activities that violate policy with zero impact to legitimate container operation.
 - **Investigate container incidents faster:** Easily investigate incidents when detections are associated with the specific container and not bundled with host events.
 - **See everything:** Capture container start, stop, image, runtime information and all events generated inside each and every container.
 - **Deploy seamlessly with Kubernetes:** Deploy easily at scale by including it as part of a Kubernetes cluster.
 - **Improve container orchestration:** Capture Kubernetes namespace, pod metadata, process, file and network events.

## About FalconContainer Custom Resource
Falcon Operator introduces FalconContainer Custom Resource to the cluster. The resource is meant to be singleton and it will install, configure and uninstall Falcon Container Sensor on the cluster.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To start the Falcon Container installation please push the following FalconContainer resource to your cluster. You will need to provide CrowdStrike API Keys and CrowdStrike cloud region for the installation. It is recommended to establish new API credentials for the installation at https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/support/api-clients-and-keys, minimal required permissions are:
> * Falcon Images Download: **Read**
> * Sensor Download: **Read**

No other permissions shall be granted to the new API key pair.

--from-literal=falcon-client-id=$FALCON_CLIENT_ID \
--from-literal=falcon-client-secret=$FALCON_CLIENT_SECRET \
--from-literal=falcon-cid=$FALCON_CID \
--from-literal=falcon-provisioning-token=$FALCON_PROVISIONING_TOKEN
```

#### Advanced Settings
The following settings provide an alternative means to select which version of Falcon sensor is deployed. Their use is not recommended. Instead, an explicit SHA256 hash should be configured using the `image` property above.

See `docs/ADVANCED.md` for more details.

| Spec | Default Value | Description |
| :- | :- | :- |
| advanced.autoUpdate | `off` | Automatically updates a deployed Falcon sensor as new versions are released. This has no effect if a specific image or version has been requested. Valid settings are:<ul><li>`force` -- Reconciles the resource after every check for a new version</li><li>`normal` -- Reconciles the resource whenever a new version is detected</li><li>`off` -- No automatic updates</li></ul>
| advanced.updatePolicy | _none_ | If set, applies the named Linux sensor update policy, configured in Falcon UI, to select which version of Falcon sensor to install. The policy must be enabled and must match the CPU architecture of the cluster (AMD64 or ARM64). |

##### Automatic Update Frequency
The operator checks for new releases of Falcon sensor once every 24 hours by default. This can be adjusted by setting the `--sensor-auto-update-interval` command-line flag to any value acceptable by [Golang's ParseDuration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) function. However, it is strongly recommended that this be left at the default, as each cycle involves queries to the Falcon API and too many could result in throttling.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All arguments are optional, but successful deployment requires either **client_id and client_secret or the Falcon cid and image**. When deploying using the CrowdStrike Falcon API, the container image and CID will be fetched from CrowdStrike Falcon API. While in the latter case, the CID and image location is explicitly specified by the user.

### Enabling and Disabling Falcon Container injection

By default, all pods in all namespaces outside of `kube-system` and `kube-public` will be subject to Falcon Container injection.

To disable sensor injection for all pods in one namespace, add a label to the namespace:
```yaml
sensor.falcon-system.crowdstrike.com/injection=disabled
```

If `injector.disableDefaultNamespaceInjection` is set to `true`, then sensor injection will be disabled in all namespaces by default. To enable injection for all pods in one namespace with default namespace injection set to `true`, add a label to the namespace:
```yaml
sensor.falcon-system.crowdstrike.com/injection=enabled
```

To disable sensor injection for one pod, add an annotation to the pod spec:
```yaml
sensor.falcon-system.crowdstrike.com/injection=disabled
```

If `injector.disableDefaultPodInjection` is set to `true`, then sensor injection will be disabled for all pods by default. To enable injection for one pod in a namespace subject to injection, add an annotation to the pod spec:
```yaml
sensor.falcon-system.crowdstrike.com/injection=enabled
```

### Auto Proxy Configuration

{{ template "proxy.tmpl" . }}

### Image Registry considerations

Falcon Container Image is distributed by CrowdStrike through CrowdStrike Falcon registry. Operator supports two modes of deployment:

#### (Option 1) Use CrowdStrike registry directly

Does not require any advanced set-ups. Users are advised to use the following excerpt in theirs FalconContainer custom resource definition.

```yaml
registry:
  type: crowdstrike
```

Falcon Container product will then be installed directly from CrowdStrike registry. Any new deployment to the cluster may contact CrowdStrike registry for the image download. The `falcon-crowdstrike-pull-secret imagePullSecret` is created in all the namespaces targeted for injection.

#### (Option 2) Let operator mirror Falcon Container image to your local registry

Requires advanced set-up to grant the operator push access to your local registry. The operator will then mirror Falcon Container image from CrowdStrike registry to your local registry of choice.
Supported registries are: acr, ecr, gcr, and openshift. Each registry type requires advanced set-up enable image push.

Consult specific deployment guides to learn about the steps needed for image mirroring.

 - [Deployment Guide for OpenShift](../../deployment/openshift/README.md)
{{- else if eq .Distro "openshift" }}

{{- end }}

#### (Option 3) Use a custom Image URI

Image must be available at the specified URI; setting the image attribute will cause registry settings to be ignored. No image mirroring will be leveraged.

Example:
```yaml
image: myprivateregistry.internal.lan/falcon-container/falcon-sensor:6.47.0-3003.container.x86_64.Release.US-1
```

### Install Steps
To install Falcon Container (assuming Falcon Operator is installed):
```sh
{{ .KubeCmd }} create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crowdstrike/falcon-operator/main/config/samples/falcon_v1alpha1_falconcontainer.yaml --edit=true
```

### Uninstall Steps
To uninstall Falcon Container simply remove the FalconContainer resource. The operator will uninstall the Falcon Container product from the cluster.

```sh
{{ .KubeCmd }} delete falconcontainers.falcon.crowdstrike.com --all
```

### Namespace Reference

The following namespaces will be used by Falcon Operator.

| Namespace               | Description                                                      |
|:------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| falcon-system           | Used by Falcon Container product, runs the injector, and webhoook |
| falcon-operator         | Runs falcon-operator manager                                      |

### Sensor upgrades

To upgrade the sensor version, simply add and/or update the `version` field in the FalconContainer resource and apply the change. Alternatively if the `image` field was used instead of using the Falcon API credentials, add and/or update the `image` field in the FalconContainer resource and apply the change. The operator will detect the change and perform the upgrade.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The operator will only upgrade the injector service. You will need to restart or roll your workload deployments to upgrade the sidecar version.

### Troubleshooting

- Falcon Operator modifies the FalconContainer CR based on what is happening in the cluster. You can get list the CR, Operator Version, and Sensor version by running the following:

  ```sh
  $ {{ .KubeCmd }} get falconcontainers.falcon.crowdstrike.com
  NAME                    OPERATOR VERSION   FALCON SENSOR
  falcon-sidecar-sensor   0.8.0              6.51.0-3401.container.x86_64.Release.US-1
  ```

  This is helpful information to use as a starting point for troubleshooting.
  You can get more insight by viewing the FalconContainer CRD in full detail by running the following command:

  ```sh
  {{ .KubeCmd }} get falconcontainers.falcon.crowdstrike.com -o yaml
  ```

- To review the logs of Falcon Operator:
  ```sh
  {{ .KubeCmd }} -n falcon-operator logs -f deploy/falcon-operator-controller-manager -c manager
  ```

- To review the logs of Falcon Container Sidecar Injector service:
  ```sh
  {{ .KubeCmd }} logs -n falcon-system -l "crowdstrike.com/provider=crowdstrike"
  ```

- To review the currently deployed version of the operator:
  ```sh
  {{ .KubeCmd }} get falconnodesensors -A -o=jsonpath='{.items[].status.version}'
  ```

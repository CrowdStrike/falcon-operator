# Deployment Guide for OpenShift

This document will guide you through the installation of the Falcon Operator and deployment of the following custom resources provided by the Falcon Operator:
- [FalconAdmission](resources/admission/README.md) with the Falcon Admission Controller image being mirrored from CrowdStrike container registry to OpenShift ImageStreams (on cluster registry).
- [FalconImageAnalyzer](resources/imageanalyzer/README.md) with the Falcon Image Analyzer image being pulled from CrowdStrike container registry.
- [FalconNodeSensor](resources/node/README.md) custom resource to the cluster.

You can choose to install the operator and custom resources through the [web console (GUI)](#installing-the-operator-through-the-web-console-gui) or through the [CLI](#installing-the-operator-through-the-cli).
If you want to automate the deployment of the operator, the CLI method is recommended.

> [!WARNING]
> Previous versions of this guide discussed deployment of the [FalconContainer](resources/container/README.md) resource, but this is no longer recommended for OpenShift. Instead, OpenShift users should only use the FalconNodeSensor for runtime protection. FalconContainer is designed for other Kubernetes environments and is not intended for OpenShift.

## Prerequisites

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - The correct CrowdStrike Cloud (not Endpoint) subscription
> - CrowdStrike API Key Pair (*if installing the CrowdStrike Sensor via the CrowdStrike API*)
>
>    > If you need help creating a new API key pair, review our docs: [CrowdStrike Falcon](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/support/api-clients-and-keys).
>
>  Make sure to assign the following permissions to the key pair:
>  - Falcon Images Download: **Read**
>  - Sensor Download: **Read**

### Managed OpenShift Considerations

> [!IMPORTANT]
> On managed OpenShift services (e.g. ROSA Classic, ARO, RHOIC, OSD), Red Hat does not support running any workloads on control plane and infrastructure nodes (including OpenShift-certified operators like this one). For managed OpenShift services that provide access to control plane nodes _only_, you must choose one of these deployment options:
>
> 1. **Deploy the Falcon sensor only to worker nodes.** This introduces risk by not having visibility and protection on control plane and infrastructure nodes, but maintains full support from Red Hat Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). To do so, set `spec.node.tolerations: []` on `FalconNodeSensor`.
>
> 2. **Deploy the Falcon sensor to all nodes.** This provides full protection for the cluster, but may prevent Red Hat SRE from maintaining your service level agreement (SLA) for availability. We recommend working with your Red Hat account team to submit a support exception in this case. This is the default behavior of the operator, so no configuration is required. For more information, see the Red Hat support article [Running custom workloads in OSD/ROSA control plane or infra nodes](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6972101).
>
> These constraints are specific to managed OpenShift services. ROSA with Hosted Control Planes (HCP) is not affected because it does not provide access to the control plane. The Falcon sensor is _always_ supported on _all_ node types for self-managed OpenShift clusters, regardless of whether they are running on-premises or in the cloud.

## Installing the operator through the CLI

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>

### Install using the Subscription/CSV method

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>

- Authenticate to your OpenShift cluster
  ```
  oc login --token=sha256~abcde-ABCDE-1 --server=https://openshift.example.com
  ```

- If you are not installing the Falcon Operator in the `openshift-operators` namespace, create either the `falcon-operator` namespace or a desired custom namespace:
  ```
  oc new-project falcon-operator
  ```

- Verify that the Falcon Operator exists in the cluster's OperatorHub
  ```
  oc get packagemanifests -n openshift-marketplace | grep falcon
  ```

- You can view the package manifest by running the following command:
  ```
  oc describe packagemanifests falcon-operator -n openshift-certified
  ```
  or to get the package manifest in yaml form:
  ```
  oc get packagemanifests -n openshift-marketplace falcon-operator -o yaml
  ```
  Important information from the package manifest output such as the `defaultChannel`, `catalogSource`, `catalogSourceNamespace`, and `currentCSV` are used to create a `Subscription` Kind in a yaml file (next steps) to have OpenShift install the operator from the cluster's marketplace.
  You can now install the official [Red Hat certified version of the operator](#installing-the-red-hat-certified-operator-from-the-console-operatorhub).

#### Installing the Red Hat Certified Operator from the Console OperatorHub
##### Creating an OperatorGroup

- If using a custom namespace or the `falcon-operator` namespace, you will need to create an `OperatorGroup`:
  ```
  cat << EOF >> operatorgroup.yaml
  apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
  kind: OperatorGroup
  metadata:
    name: falcon-operator
    namespace: falcon-operator
  EOF
  ```
  Then, deploy the newly created `OperatorGroup`:
  ```
  oc create -f operatorgroup.yaml -n falcon-operator
  ```
  An [example OperatorGroup for you to modify is available](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CrowdStrike/falcon-operator/main/docs/deployment/openshift/operatorgroup.yaml)

##### Installing the Red Hat Operator from the Console OperatorHub

- Create a subscription `yaml` file to install the official Red Hat certified operator (`certified-operators`). In this example, the certified operator will be installed via the `Subscription` Kind:
  ```
  cat << EOF >> subscription.yaml
  apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
  kind: Subscription
  metadata:
    name: falcon-operator
  spec:
    channel: certified-1.0
    name: falcon-operator
    source: certified-operators
    sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
  EOF
  ```
  Replace the `channel` in the above spec to the desired deployment channel e.g. `certified-X` (where X is the version), or `stable`, etc. An [example subscription of the official Red Hat certified operator is available](redhat-subscription.yaml) to use and modify as appropriate for your cluster. If a specific operator version is desired, add `startingCSV` with the desired operator version e.g. `startingCSV: falcon-operator.v0.1.2`.

  Red Hat docs for operator subscription spec options: https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.19/html/operatorhub_apis/subscription-operators-coreos-com-v1alpha1

#### Deploy the operator

Deploy the `subscription.yaml` that you create to the cluster for the operator to install.

- Deploy the operator using the `subscription.yaml`
  ```
  oc create -f subscription.yaml -n falcon-operator
  ```

## Upgrading

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>

When the operator was installed in OpenShift, the choice was given to use either an `Automatic` approval strategy or a `Manual` approval strategy.
If an `Automatic` approval strategy was chosen, the operator will update itself when OpenShift detects a new version in the update channel.
If a `Manual` approval strategy was chosen, the update must be approved for the operator to update. See [https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/operators/admin/olm-upgrading-operators.html#olm-approving-pending-upgrade_olm-upgrading-operators](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/operators/admin/olm-upgrading-operators.html#olm-approving-pending-upgrade_olm-upgrading-operators).
